# Langenferner Mass Balance Data

Since the hydrological year 2004 Langenferner, a small valley glacier in the Italian Ortler-Alps, is subject to detailed glaciological investigations. Through the past years some effort was taken to perform the measurements and analyses more systematically and hence reach a higher scientific value of the data. The purpose of this site is to share the outcome of this project, but also make it transparent by making all data available to the community.

While this site is beeing created visit the [project at the ACINN website](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/research/ice-and-climate/projects/mass-balance-vedretta-lunga.html.en) for some basic info.

## data content

In its final form the repository should contain the following: 

 - raw and corrected point measurements of mass balance in a standardized form
 - values of mean specific mass balance for 50m altitde bands and the entire glacier  
 - spatially extrapolated mass balance data as rasters of 1m  spatial resolution
 - topographic reference data such as shapefiles of glacier extent and altitude bands, as well as digital terrain models
 - reports and papers documenting field work and analyses
 - selected set of pictures documenting condtitions and changes of the glacier
 
and some more...
